## Some comments and decisions

# Styling:
For the sake of simplicity, I used the material-ui package to create the filters inputs (Multiple Select, Slider, and Checkbox)

# Testing:
I think tests are important, and although I didn't create tests for all the components, you can check some examples in the folder `components`, there I implemented tests for each component using `jest` and `@testing-library`. I didn't add any snapshots but that is also a possibility

# Reading and formating the CSV file
To read the file I used the javascript `fetch` function and to format the file in a code-readable object I used the package `papaparse`, I found some alternatives for the last one, but `papaparse` seemed to be the simplest.

# Internationalisation
For that, I used `i18n` and I added a dropdown button upper right side of the page where you can switch between English and German.
Note: As I don't really know German I used Google Translate to translate the text, hopefully the translation is correct.

# Google Maps
Since Google Maps requires a key to correctly display a map I got a Google Cloud Platform key to for it. The key only has 300$ of usage (which is the trial limit) hopefully is enough.
Note: the key is accessible in the GitHub although I'm aware that we shouldn't have easy accessibly keys especially in a public repo. But in this case, it shouldn't be a problem.
